# cloud-in-a-box
Disaster relief edge compute launched at the [Worthy Web Hackathon](https://progress-worthyweb.devpost.com/) where we have a [Project Page](https://devpost.com/software/cloud-in-a-box)

The full stack is Raspberry PI -> Kubernetes -> .Net 5 -> Oqtane -> Blazor -> Telerik UI for Blazor.  That's a lot, so let's break this into the Software side and the DevOps side.

## Software
The main portal is an [Oqtane](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework) so get started there.  If you can get that up and running on your laptop, you have the skills to start working on the various parts of the app.  This repo has the custom modules, and Teleriik UI components.

## DevOps
To get started with Kubernetes, install the latest version of docker desktop and check the box for Kubernetes.  You might need to update your version of windows and enable WSL2.  If you can get that rolling, you'll be one step closer to doing Devops.

## work in progress
I'm updating these docs daily as we get started on this project, there are 40 days to go on this one, so it will be a slow start as we are building the team.  I'm also working full time, so I only have a few hours a day for this project.
